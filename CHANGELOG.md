# Changelog

All notable changes to SnowRaven are documented here.

## [0.0.6] - 2026-05-08

### Added
- "Edit on eBird" link appears in the results area after a successful weather lookup, linking directly to the eBird edit page for that checklist (`https://ebird.org/edit/effort?subID=…`)

## [0.0.5] - 2026-05-08

### Added
- `update.sh` script: one command to pull, rebuild, and restart the app (`./update.sh` from the repo root)
- "Check For Updates" link in the app footer: checks GitHub for a newer release on demand, showing version status inline (no passive network requests)
- `/version/check` backend endpoint: server-side GitHub API check that keeps the client IP off GitHub

## [0.0.4] - 2026-05-08

### Added
- Checklist confirmation line displayed after a successful weather lookup, showing the resolved checklist ID, location name, and observation time (e.g. `S334315671 / Berkeley Community Garden / 2026-05-07 17:26`)

## [0.0.3] - 2026-05-07

### Added
- List Comparer tab: drag-and-drop two eBird backup CSV files to see which species appear in both lists and which are unique to each
- "Show all / Collapse" toggle on comparison results to expand all three species panels to full length (useful for printing)

### Added
- Weather output is now automatically copied to the clipboard on a successful lookup (with legacy fallback for non-HTTPS contexts)
